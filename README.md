# YOLO-Jasmine
The YOLO Jasmine Bud Detection project focuses on classifying jasmine buds into open buds and closed buds using advanced YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architectures.   Custom datasets of jasmine flowers were collected and annotated, followed by training and fine-tuning of YOLO models (YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 variants).
